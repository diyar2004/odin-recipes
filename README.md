This is the Odin Recipes project, a part of my learning journey. In this 
project, I will be demonstrating the following skills:

- Creating a GitHub repository.
- Cloning a repository to my local machine.
- Writing and editing Markdown files, such as this README.
- Managing project files using Git.

Stay tuned for more updates as I work on this project!
